Trigger: If John lemon in front of ghost and John lemon is within 25 degrees of ghost's field of vision (ignore distance), the speed of ghost will be double (As a balance of difficulty, shrunking ghost's capture distance, so now it's more like capturing the range than PointOfView).
*The walls cannot block the view of ghosts
